## VISION
Nowadays indoor fitness becomes more normally around us. Through the long-term research and analysis. Scientist find that playing music while exercising can improve the result of fitness. It’s not only makes the speed of metabolism, burning of fat faster but also exercise the endurance of the practitioner, improve self-confidence. 

By the way,different exercising should match up different music rhythm. Consider to people who have no enough time to go to the Gym after work or study, () creating a good atmosphere while you doing fitness at home. According to the heart beats of user, the system can play the different music with suitable rhythm. All the music are divided to different kinds. At the same time, each kind of music provide suitable light around the space in order to make user feel more relaxed and enjoy the fitness.

() provide the distinctive fitness experience different from the Gym in your private space. It is suited for all the people who prefer to do fitness at home.

## AMI MAIN STEPS

### SENSING
External temperature sensors sense and scanning the users’ calendar. (OPTIONAL: heart beat sensor)

### REASONING
According sensing detections, M.R is able to analysis and try to find the compatible preset ambient settings.

### ACTING
The system is able to contact and control Lamps, speaker and monitor.

### INTERACTING
 We provide button and interface to control our system.

## AMI FEATURES

### SENSITIVE
The system can sense outside temperatuer , weather conditions and users’ scalendar.

### RESPONSIVE
By analysing the data, the system can change the ambient devices.

### ADAPTIVE
The system performs different atmosphere depends on users’ mood.

### TRANSPARENT
System can be modified easily if needed.

### Ubiquitous
The system can be deployed in any private space as users’ wish.

### INTELLIGENT
According to the sensing data, the system can change the related devices automatically.

## OPEN ISSUES
1. How can we define the different atmospheres (And how many kinds)?
2. How can we map the data of sensing to the preset modes? 
3. Which kind of front-end should we use? By website or application?
