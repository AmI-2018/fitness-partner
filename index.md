## VISION
Nowadays, as the improvement of competitiveness. People have much pressure from work and study. Lots of feelings affect our mood. The main purpose of this device is regulate the color of the illumination and the music sound intensity and melody rhythm not only with the changes of the user’s mood but also the weather and temper conditions, in order to create the right atmosphere according to the users’ mood. 

We focus on the people who need to improve the mood in their own private space. It can also realize that people with good mood  feel more comfortable. (relaxing, party, dating, sleeping,  fitness etc.) 

How does it works? We will set priorities for our sensing process. We provide a sensor act on the user directly like a smart bracelet to detects and collects information (such as heart rate, step numbers ) in first order, we either provide several sensors act on the external environment or import the calendar of the future details to the background of our ami system. 

We’ll provide two possible ways yet the user interact with our system one of the physical button the other is by using one interface to control and record the musics and photos playing and the light colors conversion as you prefer.

Considering the convenience and privacy we decide to put system into bedroom, it makes people’s feeling clearly without the influence of external factor. It’s easier to improve the mood and keep it. 

## AMI MAIN STEPS

### SENSING
External temperature sensors sense and scanning the users’ calendar. (OPTIONAL: heart beat sensor)

### REASONING
According sensing detections, M.R is able to analysis and try to find the compatible preset ambient settings.

### ACTING
The system is able to contact and control Lamps, speaker and monitor.

### INTERACTING
 We provide button and interface to control our system.

## AMI FEATURES

### SENSITIVE
The system can sense outside temperatuer , weather conditions and users’ scalendar.

### RESPONSIVE
By analysing the data, the system can change the ambient devices.

### ADAPTIVE
The system performs different atmosphere depends on users’ mood.

### TRANSPARENT
System can be modified easily if needed.

### Ubiquitous
The system can be deployed in any private space as users’ wish.

### INTELLIGENT
According to the sensing data, the system can change the related devices automatically.

## OPEN ISSUES
1. How can we define the different atmospheres (And how many kinds)?
2. How can we map the data of sensing to the preset modes? 
3. Which kind of front-end should we use? By website or application?
