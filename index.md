## VISION
//TO DO

## AMI MAIN STEPS

### SENSING
External temperature sensors sense and scanning the users’ calendar. (OPTIONAL: heart beat sensor)

### REASONING
According sensing detections, M.R is able to analysis and try to find the compatible preset ambient settings.

### ACTING
The system is able to contact and control Lamps, speaker and monitor.

### INTERACTING
 We provide button and interface to control our system.

## AMI FEATURES

### SENSITIVE
The system can sense outside temperatuer , weather conditions and users’ scalendar.

### RESPONSIVE
By analysing the data, the system can change the ambient devices.

### ADAPTIVE
The system performs different atmosphere depends on users’ mood.

### TRANSPARENT
System can be modified easily if needed.

### Ubiquitous
The system can be deployed in any private space as users’ wish.

### INTELLIGENT
According to the sensing data, the system can change the related devices automatically.

## OPEN ISSUES
1. How can we define the different atmospheres (And how many kinds)?
2. How can we map the data of sensing to the preset modes?
